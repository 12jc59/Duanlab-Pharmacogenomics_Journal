Phenotype: Tacrolimus clearance was significantly lower in patients with the nonfunctional CYP3A5 enzyme encoded by the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype (rs776746 GG) in comparison to carriers of the wild-type CYP3A5*1 ((rs776746 A) allele (p=0.013).At 1 month after transplantation, creatinine clearance was higher in patients with the CYP3A5*1 allele than in those with CYP3A5*3/*3 (117.5 24.4 vs. 97.2 28.4 ml/min), but not to a statistically significant extent (p=0.06). Tacrolimus clearance was significantly higher in patients with low (<33%) versus normal hematocrit levels (p=0.007). The individualization of tacrolimus dosage should be based on weight, hematocrit level, and CYP3A5 polymorphism to maintain therapeutic range. However, interindividual and residual variability remained large even when genetic information was taken into account. In a simulated estimation, 20% of the patients received an overdose (C(0) > 20 ng/ml), and 19% received too low a dose (C(0) < 5 ng/ml), thereby reinforcing the need for monitoring. A standard dosage of 0.15 mg/kg twice daily was associated with underdosing in children with the CYP3A5*1 ((rs776746 A) allele, thus higher dosages (0.2-0.3 mg/kg twice daily) are recommended primarily in children with body weight <20 kg and low hematocrit levels. In contrast, for children with CYP3A5*3/*3 (rs776746 GG) genotype, the lower dosage of 0.1 mg/kg twice daily should be recommended, primarily in those with body weight >40 kg. Study size: 50.
